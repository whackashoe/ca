all current work in test/treet

should merge it down once it surpasses current system / works

is there any benefit to a non tree representation?

is passing a lambda or passing a function pointer in the right design? I think that the api should allow for generic functions to be made, then selected at compiletime using maybe #define? I don't think lib design carries over well.

Way to generalize spaces? 

Way to generalize hash?
